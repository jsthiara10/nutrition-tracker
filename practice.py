# I want to set a calorie goal

# I want to see as a percentage of that goal, what my total calorie intake is 

goal = 2000

consumed = 500

percentage = (consumed/goal) * 100

print(f"You are {percentage}% of the way towards your daily calorie goal! ")

# Subtraction

subtraction = goal - consumed

print(f"You have {subtraction} calories left to consume today. ")
